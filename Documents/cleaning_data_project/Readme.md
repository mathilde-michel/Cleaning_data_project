## Getting and cleaning data course project

### Overview
This project was carried out to meet the requirements of the course project of
Getting and Cleaning Data course published on Coursera.org by the John Hopkins university
Therefore the work done consists in collecting, working with and cleaning a dataset.

In particular it was requested to:
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
   of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The evaluation criteria are the following:
1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

The source data are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Adaptations to be performed to this script

The row 2 of the script needs to be modified to correspond with your actual directory and not mine.
